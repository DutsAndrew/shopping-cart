# shopping-cart

How To:
1. Use the Nav bar at the top of the screen to navigate between the "Home, Shop, and Cart" pages.
2. On the Shop page you can browse Steam Game specials and or search games on your own.
3. You can add games from the shop page to your cart.
4. On the cart page you can view all items you've added and their total cost.
5. You can increment each item's quantity in the cart or remove the item all together.

Tools:

I used React, JS, HTML, CSS, and Jest

What I learned:
1. Getting APIs set up in react with the useEffect hook is different from what I'm used to, but I was able to get it working
2. Using Browser Router, Routes, and Link was fun to get setup and experiment with linking to new pages instead of reloading the page.

What I'd change:
1. Adding more tests in jest, I mainly implemented snapshot testing, which was new to me, but if I went back I'd add more test coverage.
